/**
 * Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices 
 * such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. 
 * Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
 * 
 * 
 *                          Algorithm 
 * We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. 
 * In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. 
 * In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. 
 * We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, 
 * then push it to a stack. 
 * Finally, print contents of stack. 
 * Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only 
 * when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
